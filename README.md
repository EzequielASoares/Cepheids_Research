# 📌 Cepheids_Research  
**Repository for storing and analyzing scientific papers on Cepheid variable stars. Part of my undergraduate research.**  

## 📄 About this repository  
This repository is dedicated to organizing and analyzing scientific papers on **Cepheid variable stars**, focusing on their classification, the Period-Luminosity relation, and reproducibility of results.  

## 📌 Research Project  

This work is part of **Titan (Astrophysics and Exoplanetology Team)**, coordinated by **Leonardo Andrade de Almeida**. For more information, check the [Lattes profile of the coordinator](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7812463045514059).  

🔗 This project is based on research developed by **Gabriel Wendell**, a master's student in the **TITAN** group, with his direct collaboration. Check out his repository: [Gabriel Wendell](https://github.com/GabrielWendell/Cepheids_Projects).  

## 📚 Structure of the repository
